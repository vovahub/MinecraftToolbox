# MinecraftToolbox
我的世界工具箱,查询在线服务器和批量查询一个域名或ip下的在线端口。

我们允许任何人更改我们的项目，但该项目使用的是Turbowarp制作，所以您需要下载SB3包并用Turbowarp打开编辑(其他的类似Turboowarp的编辑器或许也可以）
虽说我们取名这个为工具箱但事实上他只有两个功能就像前面说的，好吧或许他根本排不上用场但至少是我做的第一个开源项目:D

Minecraft Toolbox: query online servers and batch scan ports for a domain or IP.

We allow anyone to modify our project. However, since it was created using Turbowarp, you'll need to download the SB3 file and open it in Turbowarp for editing (other editors similar to Turbowarp may also work).

Although we call this a "toolbox," it actually only has two functions, as mentioned earlier. Well, it might not be very useful, but at least it's my first open-source project! :D
(Just realized the irony—an English description for a project that's not in English! sorry...):/
